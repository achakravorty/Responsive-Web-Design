                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>) or functionality/behavior (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>).
                </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</li>
                    <li>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head">
                            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
                        </a>, 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title">
                            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
                        </a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body">
                            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                        </a> and many others.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    You don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software">Installing basic software</a>), </li>
                        <li>and understand how to create and manage files.</li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Elements">
                <header>HTML Elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
                    </p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>
                        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
                <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
                <header>Nesting elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    <p>
                        You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>  element first, then the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>  element; therefore, we have to close the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>  element first, then the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The following is incorrect:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
