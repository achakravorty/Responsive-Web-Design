                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>) or functionality/behavior (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>).
                </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</li>
                    <li>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" target=”_blank”>

                    You don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software">Installing basic software</a>), </li>
                        <li>and understand how to create and manage files.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
                    </p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>
                        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                <article>
                    <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
                <header>Nesting elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    <p>
                        You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the &lt;p&gt;  element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the &lt;strong&gt;  element first, then the &lt;p&gt; element. The following is incorrect:
                    </p>
                    <code id="wrong">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Void_elements">
                <header>Void elements</header>
                <article>
                <p>
                    Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already have in our HTML page: 
                </p>
                <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;img&gt; tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
                </p>

                    That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page
                </p>
                <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My test page &lt;/title&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;
                    &lt;/html&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    Here, we have the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt; — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates. 
                </p>
                <code>&lt!-- This is a comment --&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</code>
